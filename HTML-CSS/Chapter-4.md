## HC 1.4 Aktuella webbstandarder

Web standards are standards and guidelines set by The World Wide Web Consortium [W3C]. It is highly important to follow current standards regarding web standards in HTML and CSS. One such example mentioned earlier is current standards for accessibility to facilitate users with disabilities to be able to use a website. However, there are many reasons why web developers should be up to date with current web standards. The main reasons are that websites will be easier to access, it will be compatible with different web browsers and devices and lastly, it will remain consistent across different pages. 

The current standard used in Hypertext Markup Language is HTML5. Hence it is vital to structure the web content based on HTML5 standards. For example, rather than using ```<div>``` tags to describe a specific content developers should use the ```<article>``` tag or ```<section> ``` tag. Similarly, use the heading tags at its appropriate position, such as ```<h1>``` heading located at the top and the heading with less value such as ```<h2>``` placed further down. Another similar standard to follow is to use the ```<video>``` and ```<audio>``` tag which are new in HTML5 instead of third-party plugins such as Flash. It is best practice to follow the current standards to make the website more accessible and consistent.

Regarding Cascading Style Sheets, the current standards used are CSS3. The current standards have provided developers with greater flexibility and new features. The main feature presented in CSS3 is the ability to control how a layout should be. Instead of using floats and positioning as recommended in CSS2, developers should use the current standards which are either flexbox or grid to design a layout. Similarly, rather than using mix of container, positioning, and background-images to achieve a box-shadow developers should use the box-shadow property in CSS3.

Developers are urged to use validation tools provided by W3C to check that their HTML and CSS is up to date with current web standards. Validation tools makes sure that the code meets the current standards and promotes an error free website.

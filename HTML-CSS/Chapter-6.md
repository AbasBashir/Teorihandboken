## HC 1.6 Optimering och validering av HTML & CSS

Optimization refers to enhancing the performance of a website through different means. The purpose of optimizing a website is to drive traffic, obtain a higher SEO ranking and thus earn greater revenue. Optimization comes in two different forms. These are optimizing in terms of resources and optimizing in relation to content. 

Optimization regarding resources deals with files such as .html, .css, .js, .jpg etc. There are a few ways to improve a website. One such way is to reduce the number of requests being made to the server. Optimizing this area will significantly increase the performance of the website. Another alternative is to decrease the size of images present on the website. This greatly increases performance due to the image taking up less space, hence resulting in faster loading time. In addition, choosing the correct file format increases the performance of a website. For instance, choose JPEG for photos and PNG for pictures that have less color or are transparent. Similarly, for the same reasons, a much better alternative to images are icons. 

Optimizing in terms of content refers to the content of a website. Search engine optimization (SEO) is particularly correlated to this area. Thus, it is vital that a website is optimized. There are several ways to achieve the aforementioned.

## PG 1.6 Dokumentation
Documentation is a crucial part of web development and is about extensively documenting different parts of the source code. The purpose of documenting is to encourage understanding of code, promote maintenance and facilitate collaboration with team members during different phases such as debugging, production, and maintenance. There are 2 ways to document, and these are the following: code commenting and using markdown. 

Code commenting is essentially about adding comment inside of the source. These comments are inserted either above the code or next to it. The purpose for using comments is to explain the logic of the code. By doing so, this will assist team members to understand the reasons behind the logic and thus encourages communication, it also aids the developer of the code to understand their own code after revisiting at a later period.  The comments do not only need to display functional code but can also be used to describe areas of error that require to be solved. In web development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have different ways to comment in the source code. 

To comment in HTML, there is only one way and that is by writing the text within these symbols:

 ```<!—comment here -->```.

Similarly, there is only one way to comment in CSS and that is by writing:

 ``` /* comment here */```

 Both HTML and CSS applies these symbols for both commenting on a single line and commenting on multiple lines. 

However, on the other hand, there are 2 ways to comment in JavaScript. To comment for a single line is done by writing 2 slashes such as this:

```// this is a code``` 

And commenting for multiple lines JavaScript uses the same symbols as the ones used in CSSS which are these:

``` /* comments goes here */```

The second type of documentation is by applying markdown. Markdown is a light markup that is easy to read and easy to use markup language. Markdown is used to format text. To create a markdown file in Visual Studio code, the file should be created with the extension ```.md```. The purpose is to use markdown for developers to write their own notes but is also used for writing a well-defined overview and instructions for the overall of a project and present it in GitHub for other developers to read and understand the project. When working on a markdown file, the markdown preview symbol can be pressed to view how the markdown will appear once pushed to GitHub.

Some of the most common markdown syntaxes are:

This will render as heading that represents ```<h1>``` tag:

```# Heading 1```

This will render as a link:

```[Link text](https://www.example.com)``` 

This will render as an unordered list item:

```- Unordered list item 1```

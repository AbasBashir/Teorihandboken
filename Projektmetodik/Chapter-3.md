The first stage is the idea, this is where extensive research is needed and questions such as what skills are required, are there any partners interested in joining and whether the project will make more revenue than expenses are answered. Next stage is design, this where sketches are made by using for example Figma and prototypes for UI/UX are made including getting to know target audience. Following the design stage is the implementation stage where most of the time is spent on creating API:s, graphical interface, and databases. The two last stages are testing and maintenance where the testing phase is when the software is being examined to see if it works and meets all the requirements and the maintenance phase is where general issues are being handled such as bugs and improving features.

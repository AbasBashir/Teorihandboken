Usability in web development is a measurement of how a user feels about a feature or service they interact with achieves a specific goal in an effective and satisfactory manner. Usability is tightly associated with UX design. As aforementioned, the goal of UX designer is to gather research and analyze data including understanding the target audience in order to create a user friendly and engaging website. However, part of making users have a great user experience and ultimately be satisfied, UX designer and developers set specific goals known as User Experience goals. By establishing specific goals, the product team can measure and guide the development of the product. In addition, goals help the product team more easily identify areas that require less time to focus on and areas with greater priority. 

There are several User Experience goals that can help measure usability. Four well-known examples are: discoverability, learnability, error avoidance and error recovery. For discoverability goal, ideas to consider are how easy should it be for users to locate a feature, or should it perhaps be semi-difficult to find as to allow them to explore the website? Alternatively, is it permissible for users to use a help tab or tool to find it? Regarding learnability goal, should users be coached on how to use a particular feature, or should it be left for them to figure it out themselves? In such a case how many attempts should users have? In terms of error avoidance and error recovery, viewpoints to contemplate are what types of errors are allowed to encounter and be allowed to handle and which errors are too difficult for the average user to solve? Similarly, how long of a duration is permissible for a user to identify an error and to what extent should a computer help solve the problem? These questions are important to examine to achieve an accurate measurement of usability.

## UD 1.7 Grundläggande kognitionspsykologi
Basic cognitive psychology in the context of web development involves implementing principles from cognitive psychology to the design and creation of a website. The purpose of doing this is to promote usability, effectiveness and for the website to be compatible with cognitive ability of the target audience. Another reason is to understand the limitations of what the intended audience can do and to also identify the issues users encounter and why they occur. This approach establishes a user-centric focus and improves user experience since it will be based on the user’s mindset, how they perceive and interact with the website. 

There are several cognitive processes, some of which are attention, alertness, memory, learning, reading, speaking, and listening. 

Attention is one of the most important cognitive processes. It vital to capture the user’s attention and minimize frustration. This consists of using contrasting colors and  engaging elements to make the user feel in control and interested. In addition to this, the placement of content based on a pattern such F-pattern or Z-pattern is also a way to capture the user’s attention. 

Alerting the user for important information while they are engaged is also crucial. The product team need to design an alert system that can notify the user without causing panic. A good alert system could be a single popup on the website with a sound that is relatively calm. 

Memory is a typical cognitive ability all users implement when interacting with a  website. They rely on their memory to navigate through links or menus. One approach to promote and allow users to keep relying on their memory is to make the website have a consistent layout and color. 

Regarding readability, this cognitive ability is dependent on several aspects of the website. To promote user satisfaction when users read, the product team needs to structure the text in a simplistic and distinguishable way. This means, positioning and distinguishing between headings, sections, bullet points etc. is the way to achieve a well balanced and easy to read content.

In terms of speech and listening, if the website has audio and transcripts, the product team should make sure that the audio and other forms of media such as caption is easily accessible and easy to use, especially for users with disabilities.
